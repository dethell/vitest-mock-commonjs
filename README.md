# vitest-mockrequire

## Overview

I started writing more vitest scenarios for Auth0 Action Scripts and Auth0 does not support ESM in Action Scripts, only CommonJS.
So I became frustrated trying to work around the limitation in vitest that it won't mock Node.js "require".
I understand the problems facing the maintainers of vitest:
they are focused on ESM, and if you are using a package framework with its own module loader this may not be easy to hook into and override the
loading of CommonJS modules.
And it is not common to use both ESM and CommonJS at the same time, but in the case of writing tests for Auth0 Action Scripts that
is exactly what I want to do: the scripts must use JavaScript and CommonJS, but I want the test suites to be written with ESM in either JavaScript
or TypeScript!

The CommonJS module loader for Node.js is well defined and that is what I focused on first.
Well, maybe not well defined in the documentation, but how it works is common knowledge!
So, to start I created a Node.js package that can be used to shim a "mockNodeRequire" method onto the vi object in vitest
to mock "requires" in the code under test.
The model allows for similar shims to be created in the future and delivered for other module loaders using the
common framework defined in this package.

## Configuration and Use

### Supported module loaders

| Framework Name | vi.{Method} or Function Name |
|---|---|
| Node.js | mockNodeRequire |

### Installation

With npm or yarn import this module into the test module where you want to mock CommonJS modules.
Since this is intended for unit testing, import the module as a development dependency.
The module overrrides the module loader and allows the mocking of multiple CommonJS modules.

```
$ npm install --save-dev vitest-mockrequire
```

This module depends on the "latest" version of vitest; the test suite also needs to do that to make
sure it is using the same version or the injected methods will not be found.
This happens because npm and yarn support managing multiple module versions adjacent to each other
in node_modules.

The package.json over the test-suite should specify "latest" as the version for vitest:

```
{
    "devDependencies": {
        "vitest-mockrequire": "latest"
        "vitest": "latest"
    }
}
```

### Inclusion in the test suite

Import vitest and this module in the test suite.
The order of import is not important, vitest-mockrequire will import vi itself to inject the methods.
What other exports from vitest you import are up to you, this is just an example:

```
import { beforeAll, beforeEach, vi } from 'vitest'
import 'vitest-mockrequire'
```

vitest-mockrequire also exports the mock creation functions for direct use, simply import the named functions:

```
import { mockNodeRequire } from 'vitest-mockrequire'
```

### Mocking a CommonJS module

Mock CommonJS modules by calling the mock creation function.
This example shows both forms.
{} is used as a placeholder here for the actual test double:

```
vi.mockNodeRequire('auth0', {}) // or directly with mockNodeRequire('auth0', {})
```

TypeScript declarations are included in the index.d.ts file, so this should be directly useable
with TypeScript.

### The test double (a side-trip on "how to mock a CommonJS module")

The test double depends on the what the CommonJS module does.
The auth0 module is a good multi-level example.
The module itself does not have a default export.
The ManagementClient property is a class that produces an object with a users property which
is all we are interested in at the moment.
The test double must be in global space so that the mocked methods can be referenced in the tests.
It is probably best to "hoist" them too, in case there is anything else in a common declaration
used for mocking or spying:

```
const mocks = vi.hoisted(() => {

    const managementClient = {

        users: {

            delete: vi.fn(async (requestParameters) => new Promise((resolve) => resolve()))
        }
    }

    class ManagementClient {

        constructor() {

            this.users =  managementClient.users
        }
    }

    const mocks = {

        auth0Mock: {
            
            ManagementClient: ManagementClient,
            managementClient: managementClient
        }
    }

    return mocks
})
```

If you follow this carefully, the class definition and the static object the class is always evaluated as (for mocking) are
attached to a property hoisted before using vitest and available in the global "mocks" variable.
That way they can both be referenced for "expect" assertions in the tests!

We only need to mock the CommonJS module(s) once; so that could be done in the hoisted code or it could be placed in
a definition of *beforeAll*:

```
describe('Action tests', async () => {

    beforeAll(async () => {

        vi.mockNodeRequire('auth0', mocks.auth0Mock)
    })
```

All that is left is checking to see if the function was actually called in the code under test:

```
    it('Rejects authentication when the only deny entry is the denied user', async () => {

        mocks.eventMock.secrets.deny = 'calicojack@pyrates.live'
        mocks.eventMock.user.email = 'calicojack@pyrates.live'

        await onExecutePostLogin(mocks.eventMock, mocks.apiMock)

        expect(mocks.auth0Mock.managementClient.users.delete).toHaveBeenCalled()
    })
```

There are test double definitions missing in the example, hinted at by the individual test case above.
The whole working, stand-alone example that uses vitest-mockrequire and from which
these examples were pulled can be seen at https://github.com/jmussman/auth0-block-idp-signup. 

### The code-under-test (CUT)

The mocked CommonJS module will be loaded in the code under test because the module loader has
been overridden to do so.
This is what the CUT from the example looks like, and there is nothing in there to knowingly support
the test (a fundamental principles of testing):

```
const ManagementClient = require('auth0').ManagementClient;

const managementClient = new ManagementClient({

    domain: event.secrets.domain,
    clientId: event.secrets.clientId,
    clientSecret: event.secrets.clientSecret,
});

...

await managementClient.users.delete({ id: event.user.user_id });
```

## Implementation (how it works)

vitest fits with ESM very well, while jest fits with CommonJS.
Because the focus is ESM, vitest-mockrequire is only delivered as an ESM module.
Of course an index.d.ts file is provided for TypeScript compatibility.

### 

CommonJS require loads modules when called, not hoisted to the top of the module.
Because of this, there is no requirement to hoist an overload of require before anything
else in a module load.
This model defines a function that may be used:

```
async function mockNodeRequire(module, testDouble) {
}

vi.mockNodeRequire = mockNodeRequire

export default mockNodeRequire
```

### Multiple Module Mocking

This model extends some examples that are found around the Internet, but adds mocking multiple
CommonJS modules at the same time.
An object named *testDoubles* is attached to the function object to remember the test double
for each module, using the module name as an object property name.
Strict mode blocks a standalone function from having a *this* pointer that points to itself;
to get arround this the function is named using the classic JavaScript declaration and the name references
the function within itself:

```
async function  mockNodeRequire(module, testDouble) {

    if (!Object.getOwnPropertyNames(mockRequire).testDoubles) {

        mockNodeRequire.testDoubles = {}
```

### Overridding Module._load

Overriding the Node.js module loader is fairly simple with ESM.
In this model the override is handled in the function that will be used for mocking, the first time the
function is called.
To override Node.js "module" is imported and the _load function overridden.
After the override, or if it was already overridden, the test double is added to the testDoubles object.
When require is called in the CUT, the new _load method looks at the module requested and either serves
the double or uses the original _load method to serve the actual module if no double exists:

```
async function  mockNodeRequire(module, testDouble) {

    if (!mockNodeRequire.testDoubles) {

        mockNodeRequire.testDoubles = {}

        const { Module } = await import('module')

        Module._load_original = Module._load

        Module._load = (uri, parent) => {

            const result = mocNodeRequire.testDoubles[uri] ?? Module._load_original(uri, parent)

            return result
        }
    }

    mockNodeRequire.testDoubles[module] = testDouble
}
```

The last step is the index.js module.
This loads all of the defined mock creation modules for different module loaders and attaches them
too the vi object:

```
import { vi } from 'vitest'
import mockNodeRequire from '../src/mockNodeRequire'

vi.mockNodeRequire = mockNodeRequire

export { mockNodeRequire }
```

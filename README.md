# vitest-mockrequire

## Overview

To be frank, I started writing more vitest scenarios for Auth0 Action Scripts and Auth0 does not support ESM in Action Scripts, only CommonJS.
I became tired of trying to work around the limitation in vitest that it won't mock Node.js "require".
I get the problems facing the maintainers of vitest.
If you are using a package framework with its own module loader this is not easy to do.
But, I am running unit tests in Node.js, and the module loader is well defined.
Well, not in the documentation, but it is!

So, I created a Node.js package that can be used to shim a "mockRequire" method onto the vi object in vitest to mock "requires" in
the code under test.
